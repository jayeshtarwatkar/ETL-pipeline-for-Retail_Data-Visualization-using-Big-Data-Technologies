# ETL-pipeline-for-Retail_Data-Visualization-using-Big-Data-Technologies
Developed an ETL pipeline using Apache Spark to automate the process of collecting, cleaning, and preparing retail data for visualization. The pipeline extracts data from a variety of sources, including .xlsx files and relational databases. The data is then cleaned and prepared for visualization using PySpark.
